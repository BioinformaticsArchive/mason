The "<a href="build_scripts">build_scripts</a>" directory contains the script necessary to build Mason from scratch from the JavaScript present in the <a href="mason_source">mason_source</a> directory.

The "<a href="mason_source">mason_source</a>" directory contains the root source code to build the Mason viewer JavaScript file, as well as the Mason Viewer registry that allows inter-viewer communication.

<b>Note:</b> If you are looking to download Mason for installation on your site, you should probably download one of the pre-built JavaScript files in our <a href="../mason_download">mason_download</a> directory.
