This script builds the Mason core JavaScript files from the JavaScript files present in the <a href="../mason_source/mason_core">source directory</a>.

This script is expecting "yuicompressor-2.4.8.jar" (https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/releases) to be present in the parent of the root directory of the Mason checkout.
