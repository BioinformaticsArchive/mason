# Mason Documentation

This documentation is geared towards those wishing to build their own module or wishing to understand how Mason is architected. Developing your own module does require knowledge of JavaScript, and the steps for doing so are outlined below.

However, you may not need to build your own module, as we have developed what we call a "Generic JSON" module capable of displaying any data presented in JSON format and requires no knowledge of JavaScript. We have additionally pre-built several modules that support native output from some popular protein annotations algorithms (such as coiled-coild or transmembrane predictions) and also require no knowledge of JavaScript. Documentaton, demonstrations, and download files for the "Generic JSON" and pre-built modules are available <a href="http://www.yeastrc.org/mason/">here</a>.
