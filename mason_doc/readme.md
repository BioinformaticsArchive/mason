# Mason Documentation
This documentation is geared towards those wishing to build their own module or wishing to understand how Mason is architected. Developing your own module does require knowledge of JavaScript, and the steps for doing so are outlined below.


## Generic JSON module
You probably do not need to build your own module! We have developed a module that requires no knowledge of JavaScript to implement and is capable of parsing simple JSON containing data to be displayed, which supports overlapping annotations, user-specified coloring, user-specified per-block tooltips, and user-specified URLs for linking from annotations.

## Pre-built modules
In addition to the <a href="http://www.yeastrc.org/mason/generic-json-module.html">generic JSON module</a>, we have built several modules that support the native output from several popular protein annotations programs. These include Paircoil2 (coiled-coil), DISOPRED (disordered regions), PSIPRED (secondary structure), and Philius (transmembrane and signal peptide).
