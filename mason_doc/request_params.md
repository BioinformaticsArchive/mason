# Request Params

Recall that the Mason viewer is instantiated with JavaScript similar to:

```javascript
MasonViewer.createMasonViewer( $rootDiv, requestParams, configParams, callbackFunctionsObj );
```
In this document, we describe the "requestParams" object, which contains the data to be displayed in the Mason viewer.
