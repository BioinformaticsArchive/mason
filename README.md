# Mason
### A JavaScript widget for viewing sequence features and annotations

Mason is a JavaScript and SVG-based viewer meant to display annotated regions or features of DNA and protein sequences. Mason is designed to be portable (integrated into any web site), flexible (supporting annotation data from any source), and easy-to-use (the provided "Generic JSON module" requires no JavaScript knowledge to use). Mason is also extremely customizable, and with knowledge of JavaScript, may be greatly extended and customized through the use of callback functions passed into the Mason Viewer object.
