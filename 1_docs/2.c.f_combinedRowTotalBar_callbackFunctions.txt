  The functions of the object combinedRowTotalBar_callbackFunctions.
  
  These functions are for the combined row total bar to the right of main viewer blocks.
  
  
  The object combinedRowTotalBar_callbackFunctions must contain the 

			  	precomputeValuesOnCreate
				getColorAndSize
			  
  
   		can contain the following functions:
  
				getTotalBarToolTipText
				processClick
	
	"precomputeValuesOnCreate" is called on initial creation of the viewer.
	"getNonOverlappingBlocksToolTipText" is called when a tool tip is shown when the block is moused over.
	"getOverlappingBlocksToolTipText" is called when a tool tip is shown when the block is moused over.
	"processClick" is called when the block is clicked on.
	
	
  The data passed in to each function is covered here:
	
    ----------------

	var precomputeValuesOnCreate = function( precomputeParams )
	
		precomputeParams is an object that contains the properties
		
			"callbackDataStorage"
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next functions functions listed.
		                       
		One way to utilize "callbackDataStorage" is to compute the tool tip HTML here and store it in 
		"callbackDataStorage" and then just pull it out in the function "getToolTipText".
  
    ----------------
  
	var getColorAndSize = function( getColorAndSizeParams )

		This function returns an object of the format 
			{ "blockSize":  ,
			  "colorForBlock":  
			}
			
			where the values for the properties of:
			
			   "blockSize" is a number between zero to one, which is used as a scaling of the width of the block
			   
			   "colorForBlock" is either:
					an object of the format { red: 1, green: 1, blue: 1 }
					where the values for the properties are the 0 to 255 rgb colors for this block
					
					or
					
					a String of the format "#RRGGBB" where "RR", "GG", and "BB" are hex colors "00" to "FF"
			
			

		The input parameter getColorAndSizeParams is an object that contains the properties

			"callbackDataStorage"		
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
    ----------------
  
	var getTotalBarToolTipText = function( getTotalBarToolTipTextParams )

		getTotalBarToolTipTextParams is an object that contains the properties 
		
			"callbackDataStorage"		
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
		
		This function must return return a string that is the HTML for the tool tip.

    ----------------

	var processClick = function( processClickParams ) {  return false; };
	
		processClickParams is an object that contains the properties 
		
			"callbackDataStorage"		
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
		
		This function will return the value returned to the click handler.
		This function normally returns false
