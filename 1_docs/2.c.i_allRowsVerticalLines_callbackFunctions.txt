  The functions of the object allRowsVerticalLines_callbackFunctions.
  
  These functions are for the vertical lines that span all the rows.
  
  
  The object allRowsVerticalLines_callbackFunctions must contain the 

			  	precomputeValuesOnCreate
				getColorForLine
			  
  
   		can contain the following functions:
  
				getLinesToolTipText
	
	"precomputeValuesOnCreate" is called on initial creation of the viewer.
	"getLinesToolTipText" is called when a tool tip is shown when the line is moused over.
	
	
  The data passed in to each function is covered here:
	
    ----------------

	var precomputeValuesOnCreate = function( precomputeParams )
	
		precomputeParams is an object that contains the properties
		
			"linePos"
			"vertLineData" 
			
			"callbackDataStorage"
		
		"linePos" is the position for this line
		"vertLineData" is the object under the "vertLineData" property for this line
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next functions functions listed.
		                       
		One way to utilize "callbackDataStorage" is to compute the tool tip HTML here and store it in 
		"callbackDataStorage" and then just pull it out in the function "getToolTipText".
  
    ----------------
  
	var getColorForLine = function( getColorForLineParams )
	
		This function returns an String of the format "#RRGGBB"
			   where the colors use hex values for the red, green, and blue for this line.
			   "RR" is the hex value for the red color
			   "GG" is the hex value for the green color
			   "BB" is the hex value for the blue color
			   The hex values are 00 to FF
			

		The input parameter getColorForLineParams is an object that contains the properties

			"linePos"
			"vertLineData" 
			
			"callbackDataStorage"
		
		"linePos" is the position for this line
		"vertLineData" is the object under the "vertLineData" property for this line
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next functions functions listed.
			
    ----------------
  
	var getLinesToolTipText = function( getToolTextParams )

		getToolTextParams is an object that contains the properties 
		
			"linePos"
			"vertLineData" 
			
			"callbackDataStorage"
		
		"linePos" is the position for this line
		"vertLineData" is the object under the "vertLineData" property for this line
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next functions functions listed.
			
		
		This function must return return a string that is the HTML for the tool tip.
