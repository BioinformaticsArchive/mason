  The functions of the object combinedRow_callbackFunctions.
  
  Just like the functions for mainRowsBlocks_callbackFunctions, 
  these functions process have special processing for blocks
  that are overlapping and the non-overlapping blocks that are
  initially hidden.
  
  In this set of functions, this is accomplished in a different way
  using the input parameters.   
  
  
  The object combinedRow_callbackFunctions must contain the 

			  	precomputeValuesOnCreate
				getColorForBlock
			  
  
   		can contain the following functions:
  
				getBlocksToolTipText
				processClick
	
	"precomputeValuesOnCreate" is called on initial creation of the viewer.
	"getBlocksToolTipText" is called when a tool tip is shown when the block is moused over.
	"processClick" is called when the block is clicked on.
	
	
  The data passed in to each function is covered here:
	
    ----------------

	var precomputeValuesOnCreate = function( precomputeParams )
	
		precomputeParams is an object that contains the properties
		
			"blockDataItems"
			"forHiddenBlocks"
			"splitAnyEntriesForRow"
			"startPos"
			"endPos"
			
			"callbackDataStorage"
		


		"blockDataItems" is the blockDataItem objects of the blocks combined to make this block, put in an array.
						   Blocks are combined when they are overlapping for a given row
						   
						   
		
		"forHiddenBlocks" and "splitAnyEntriesForRow" taken together communicate to the callback
			if there were overlapping and had to be split.

		"splitAnyEntriesForRow" is true if any of the blocks were overlapping and had to be split.		

		"forHiddenBlocks" is true if this block is a block that is not initially shown.
					This is true if the blocks were overlapping and this is an original unsplit block.
					"forHiddenBlocks" may be missing or undefined rather than false.

		"startPos" is the start position for the block
		"endPos" is the end position for the block
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next functions functions listed.
		                       
		One way to utilize "callbackDataStorage" is to compute the tool tip HTML here and store it in 
		"callbackDataStorage" and then just pull it out in the function "getToolTipText".
  
    ----------------
  
	var getColorForBlock = function( getColorForBlockParams )
	
		This function returns either:
		
			an object of the format { red: 1, green: 1, blue: 1 }
			where the values for the properties are the 0 to 255 rgb colors for this block
			
			or
			
			a String of the format "#RRGGBB" where "RR", "GG", and "BB" are hex colors "00" to "FF"
		

		The input parameter getColorForBlockParams is an object that contains the properties

			"blockDataItems"
			"forHiddenBlocks"
			"startPos"
			"endPos"
			
			"rowItem" 
			
			"callbackDataStorage"		
		


		"blockDataItems" is the blockDataItem objects of the blocks combined to make this block, put in an array.
						   Blocks are combined when they are overlapping for a given row
						   
		
		"forHiddenBlocks" is true if this block is a block that is not initially shown.
					This is true if the blocks were overlapping and this is an original unsplit block.

		"startPos" is the start position for the block
		"endPos" is the end position for the block
		
		"rowItem" is an element from the input list "rowItems" for the current row.
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
    ----------------
  
	var getBlocksToolTipText = function( getSingleBlockToolTipTextParams )

		getSingleBlockToolTipTextParams is an object that contains the properties 
		
			"blockDataItems"
			"startPos"
			"endPos"
			
			"callbackDataStorage"		
		
		
		"blockDataItems" is the blockDataItem objects of the blocks combined to make this block, put in an array.
						   Blocks are combined when they are overlapping for a given row

		"startPos" is the start position for the block
		"endPos" is the end position for the block
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
			
		
		This function must return return a string that is the HTML for the tool tip.

    ----------------

	var processClick = function( processClickParams ) {  return false; };
	
		"processClick" is only called for non-overlapping blocks, either initially shown or shown when the row is expanded.
	
		processClickParams is an object that contains the properties 
		
			"blockDataItems"
			"startPos"
			"endPos"
			
			"callbackDataStorage"		
		
		
		"blockDataItems" is the blockDataItem objects of the blocks combined to make this block, put in an array.
						   Blocks are combined when they are overlapping for a given row

		"startPos" is the start position for the block
		"endPos" is the end position for the block
		
		"callbackDataStorage" is an object tied to this specific block and will be the same object 
		                       passed to the next two functions listed, "getToolTipText" and "processClick".
			
		
		This function will return the value returned to the click handler.
		This function normally returns false
