To create a Mason Viewer on the page, javascript code calls the following function

	MasonViewer.createMasonViewer( $rootDiv, requestParams, configParams, callbackFunctionsObj );

This will return a masonViewer object which should be saved in a variable.


The parameters are explained as follows:

 	$rootDiv:
 		
 		The div on the page where the Mason Viewer will be inserted.   
 		It is a jQuery object that references 1 and only 1 div on the page.
 		
 	requestParams:
 	
 		A Javascript object that will be explained in the document 2.a_requestParams_content_for_mason_viewer.txt
 		
 		
  The masonViewer object that is created has functions/methods on it that can be called to change the Mason viewer.
  
  	To make the vertical lines specified in the request data visible and hidden, call:
  	
		masonViewer.showVerticalDataLines();

		masonViewer.hideVerticalDataLines();
