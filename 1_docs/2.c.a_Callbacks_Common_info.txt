There are certain aspects that are common in in the callback functions for every element.


1.  There is always a property of the parameter passed in called "callbackDataStorage".

	This is there to support storage of data attached to a specific SVG element in the viewer.
	This enables computations to be done and strings to be built once and then re-used 
	for later calls to the callback functions. 


2.  There is always a "precomputeValuesOnCreate" function that is called.

	This is called first and is the place to do needed calculations and create the 
	tool tip strings.
	These can then be stored in the property "callbackDataStorage".
	
	
3.	There is always some "getToolTipText" function(s) that is called to get the text to show in the tool tip.

4.	There is always a "processClick" function that is called to process a click on the element.

5.  For all blocks in the main viewer, there is a "getColorForBlock" to get the color for the block.

6.	For the "total" block on the right for the row, there is a "getColorAndSize" to get 
	   the color and the size for the block.
