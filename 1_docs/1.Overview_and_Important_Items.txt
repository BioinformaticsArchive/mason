The Mason Viewer is written in Javascript.

The Mason Viewer is designed to support a high level of application specific customization
regarding the color of the blocks, the content of the tool tips, and the click handling.

How to create a Mason Viewer is covered in 2..Creating_A_Mason_Viewer_On_The_Page.txt

The Mason Viewer can be created in multiple divs on the same page (with different data for each one).




Important Items:

1.  The div the Mason Viewer is created in must not be hidden with "display:none" at the time
       the Mason Viewer is created.  This included all parent divs or other elements.
       It can be hidden with "visibility:hidden".

2.  If the Mason Viewer (or the div it is created in) needs to be removed from the page with
	Javascript code, please see the "3.Advanced_Items.txt" file.

3.  The Mason Viewer should not be repeatedly added and removed on the active page.  
	There appears to be a memory leak that the memory is not freed when the viewer is removed from the page.
	This is noticable with large viewers ( > 4,000 blocks ) repeatedly added and removed from the page.
