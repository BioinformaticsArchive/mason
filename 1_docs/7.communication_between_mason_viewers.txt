The Mason Viewers can be created to provide communication between them.

This is used for showing block alignment of the currently highlighted block in the other viewers.

This requires calling

MasonViewerRegistryFactory.createMasonViewerRegistry() 

which returns a masonViewerRegistry object 

Then as each masonViewer is created, it is added to the masonViewerRegistry as follows:

		this.config.masonViewerRegistry.addMasonViewer( { itemKey: "sampleItemKey", masonViewer: masonViewer } );

The itemKey has to be unique across all the viewers registered with a specific registry.

If a specific masonViewer needs to be replaced in the registry, just add it again with the same key as the original
and the new masonViewer will replace the old one in the registry.
